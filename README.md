# Hang-Man
A terminal-based Hangman game written in Python that selects a random word from a large custom word list. The user guesses letters with a limited number of lives, and a visual ASCII art hangman updates after each wrong guess. The game features input validation, case insensitivity, and a clean game-over/win state.
